<h3>RAYVR Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes RAYVRâ€™s policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information. RAYVR receives your information through our website. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by RAYVR in the United States or any other country where RAYVR operates.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>We collect and use your information to provide our Services and improve them over time.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Information Collected Upon Registration</p>
<p>When you create or reconfigure a RAYVR account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Additional Information</p>
<p>You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as product information, description, and a picture. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Log Data</p>
<p>Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, and search terms.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Cookies</p>
<p>Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public profiles or promotions. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. RAYVR may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Third Party Services</p>
<p>RAYVR uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.</p>
<p>Information Sharing and Disclusure</p><br>
<p class="h5">Your Consent</p>
<p>We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your RAYVR account.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Service Providers</p>
<p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Law and Harm</p>
<p>We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect RAYVR's rights or property.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Business Transfers</p>
<p>In the event that RAYVR is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Non-Private or Non-Personal Information</p>
<p>We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public promotions or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).</p><br>
<p class="h5">Modifying Your Personal Information</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Our Policy Towards Children</p>
<p>Our Services are not directed to people under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</p><br>
<p class="h5">Changes to this Policy</p>
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at /privacy-policy. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><em>This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 25th, 2015.</em></p>
